Project Setup
=============

This chapter describes how to setup a new OE-lite project, ie. the creation of
a new OE-lite manifest and setup of an OE-lite repository for it.


From Scratch
------------

To create a new OE-lite manifest from scratch, all you need to do is:

1. Create an empty directory.
2. Create a conf/bakery.conf file.
3. Run `oe init`.
4. Convert layers to be of internal layer type.

Bakery.conf from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bakery.conf follows the OE-lite metadata syntax, or rather a subset of it.
The primary purpose os to assign a value to the variable called +OESTACK+,
which defines the OE-lite stack.

An OE-lite stack is composed of a number of OE-lite layers, with each layer
typically being a seperate git repository.

A small OE-lite stack could look like this:

--------
# OE-lite/base
OESTACK += "meta/base"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/base.git"
OESTACK .= ";branch=master"

# OE-lite/core
OESTACK += "meta/core"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/core.git"
OESTACK .= ";branch=master"

OESTACK += "lib/fetching/fetching"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/python-fetching.git"
OESTACK .= ";pythonpath=.."

OESTACK += "lib/GitPython"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/gitpython/GitPython.git"
OESTACK .= ";pythonpath="

OESTACK += "lib/urlgrabber"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/urlgrabber.git"
OESTACK .= ";pythonpath="
--------

The example above uses the two OE-lite append assignment operators "\+=" and
".=". The "+=" operator appends the a space and the value to the variable.
The ".=" just appends the value to the variable.

The resulting +OESTACK+ variable is thus a space separated list of layers.
Each layer is specified by a path and a number of parameters, separated by
";".

NOTE: Add reference to the OE-lite Bakery Manual for full documentation on the
      bakery.conf syntax here, when it is actually written...

After the `oe init` command is done, the my-bsp directory should be populated
with the following structure:

----
├── conf
│   └── bakery.conf
├── lib
│   ├── fetching
│   ├── GitPython
│   └── urlgrabber
└── meta
    ├── base
    └── core
----

and all the layers should be cloned from their upstream origin.

Example (for the copy-and-paste hungry):

[source,sh]
-----------
mkdir my-bsp
cd my-bsp
mkdir conf
emacs conf/bakery.conf
oe init
-----------

At this point, you should create the initial git commit of your brand new
OE-lite manifest:

[source,sh]
-----------
git add conf/bakery.conf
git commit -s -m "Initial commit"
-----------

You are now (almost) ready to build something.  To try this, see chapter
xref:_building[Building] for how to build.

Of-course, you might want to add some more metadata layers, and probably add
your own machine and/or distro configurations and even some custom recipes,
fx. a recipe for building a custom rootfs image.  But that is a different
story...

External Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say you are creating an OE-lite manifest for your embedded Linux BSP
project.  You of-course need to use OE-lite/core, and the simplest solution is
to just add it to the STACK by adding the following to bakery.conf:

----
OESTACK += "meta/core"
OESTACK .= ";srcuri=git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/core.git"
----

With this, users of your manifest will get an OE-lite/core layer at meta/core,
using a clone from the git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/core.git repository.

While this is definitely a lean and simple approach, it does come with a few
drawbacks.

1. You will not be able to create any commits, tags or branches to the
OE-lite/core layer.

2. When cloning the OE-lite repository, you depend on both the server hosting
the manifest repository and the oe-lite.org server.

See also appendix xref:_oe-lite_terminology[OE-lite Terminology] for
definition of internal layer.

Internal Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each layer you have added to the OE-lite stack as an external layer, you
should consider to convert it to be an internal layer to address the problems
with external layers described above.  See appendix
xref:_oe-lite_terminology[OE-lite Terminology] for definition of internal
layer.

By converting all external layers to internal layers, and thus having a
manifest consisting of only embedded and internal layers, you will have a
number of advantages:

1. When creating a clone of the OE-lite repository, you will only have to
fetch from your project OE-lite repository.

2. You will be able to create backup/redundant copies of your entire OE-lite
repository using a single command.

3. You will be able to switch back and forth between different copies of your
OE-lite repository without making any changes to the OE-lite manifest.

4. You will be able to make complete from local clones of your OE-lite
repository, without depending on any remote repositories.

For each layer you want to convert from external layer to internal layer, you
have to do the following:

1. Remove the `srcuri` parameter for the layer in conf/bakery.conf

2. Change the url entry of the layer submodule in .gitmodules to the path
   relative to the containing git super project.  Fx. the relative path of
   meta/core contained in the manifest repository is ./meta/core, and the
   relative path of lib/GitPython/git/ext/async contained in the
   lib/GitPython submodule is ./git/ext/async .

When done, run `oe update` and commit the changes in conf/bakery.conf and
.gitmodules files.

Repository Setup
----------------

This section describes how to setup an OE-lite repository, suitable for
hosting as a remote repository.  Details on how to setup hosting is out of
scope of this section.

To setup an OE-lite repository of an existing OE-lite manifest, all you need
to do is to call:

----
oe clone --bare <url> <path>
----

NOTE: OE-lite Bakery version 4.1 or newer is required for this.

This will create a new (bare) OE-lite repository clone of <url> at the local
directory <path>.  The `<url>` argument can be any valid git URL (see link:See
git[git clone documentation] for more on this).  This even includes a local
path to an OE-lite manifest repository, which is handy for setting up the
first OE-lite repository right after creation of a new OE-lite manifest.

All internal layers will be cloned (recursively) together with the manifest
repository. Any other git submodules (ie. git submodules with absolute url's
or relative paths different from the path relative to the git super project)
will not be cloned.
