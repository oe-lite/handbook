Trigonometric utilities
=======================

Instead of showing a small *working* recipe, we'll start small and
show what fails at each step and explain how to fix it.

Suppose we wish to have utilities ``sin``, ``cos`` and ``tan`` that
will compute these trigonometric functions. To keep the number of
files small, we just use a single source file and some preprocessor
magic. So we create this directory tree::

  recipes/trig/
              ├── files
              │   └── trig.c
              └── trig_0.1.oe


The file ``trig.c`` is simply:

.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/trig.c
   :language: c
   :caption: recipes/trig/files/trig.c

Our first attempt at describing how to build this to OE-lite is this:

.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/trig_0.1.oe
   :language: oe
   :caption: recipes/trig/trig_0.1.oe

The ``DESCRIPTION`` and ``LICENSE`` variables are self-explanatory -
neither are mandatory, but both are highly recommended. When possible,
it is recommended to use `SPDX identifiers
<https://spdx.org/licenses/>`_ in the ``LICENSE`` fields.

The ``RECIPE_TYPES`` variable should be a space-separated list of the
targets this recipe is applicable to. The default is ``machine``, but
since there's nothing machine-specific about this small utility, we
also include the ``native`` target. That allows us to say ``oe bake
native:trig`` to have OE-lite build the recipe for our host machine,
in turn allowing us to test the programs without transferring to the
target.

The ``inherit c`` is an example of the use of a `class <OE-lite
class>`. Even the simplest recipes will usually inherit a few
classes. The ``c`` class ensures that a suitable (cross-)compiler gets
`staged <staging>` and that variables such as ``CC`` get appropriate
values. This would be very tedious to set up manually, especially if
one wants the same recipe to work for multiple target architectures.

Next, we need to tell OE-lite the source files needed. In our case,
there is just one. Local files (as indicated by the ``file://``
prefix) are searched for in a number of subdirectories of the
directory containing the recipe file: First, ``${PN}-${PV}``, then
``${PN}`` and finally ``files``. This scheme allows sharing (and
non-sharing) files between different recipes and versions of the same
recipe. In our case, that's not important, so we just put the file in
the ``files`` subdirectory.

Finally, we need to tell OE-lite how to actually compile our
programs. We do this by defining a shell function called
``do_compile``. In a larger project, we would most likely have created
a Makefile or used autotools, but here a simple shell loop is
sufficient.

Let's try this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ oe bake trig -y
   machine:trig_0.1:do_stage started
   machine:trig_0.1:do_stage finished - 0.521 s

   CRITICAL: bake failed: error: 1

It can sometimes be difficult to see what the problem actually
is. Here the compiler complains that ``trig.c`` cannot be found - yet
we clearly listed that as a source file. We can also see that the
do_unpack task succeeded, so it *should* be there. The problem is,
what does *there* mean? Let's inspect the workdir:

.. code-block:: console

  $ tree -F -L 3 tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/

  21 directories, 10 files

Here we see the problem: do_compile was run in the
``${WORKDIR}/src/trig-0.1/`` directory (aka ``${S}`` – see also the
section `task-directories`), but ``trig.c`` has been put in
``${WORKDIR}/src`` (aka ``${SRCDIR}``). The simplest fix is to make
``S`` and ``SRCDIR`` the same. So we change our recipe like this:

.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/2.diff
   :language: diff

With this in place, let's try again.

.. code-block:: console

   oe bake trig -y
   ...
   + cd /mnt/xfs/devel/oe-lite/tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/src
   + do_compile
   + for f in sin cos tan
   + arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o sin -DFUNC=sin -O2 trig.c
   /tmp/ccrw5e1U.o: In function `main':

   CRITICAL: bake failed: error: 1

Right, we didn't provide the ``-lm`` linker flag. OK, that's easy to fix.

.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/3.diff
   :language: diff

Once more. What can possibly go wrong now?

.. code-block:: console

   $ oe bake trig -y
   ...
   ERROR: machine:trig_0.1:do_compile failed  /mnt/xfs/devel/oe-lite/tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/tmp/do_compile.20161102092251.log

   CRITICAL: bake failed: error: 1

That this fails is actually a good thing, because it shows that
OE-lite works as expected! We've told the linker to link with
libm. But we haven't told OE-lite that that library is needed, so it
hasn't been `staged <staging>`. Telling OE-lite about build-time
dependencies is precisely what the ``DEPENDS`` variable is for. By
inheriting the ``c`` class, we've already told OE-lite that we depend
on the standard C library (and its header files), but libm is a
separate library. Now what we understand the problem, the fix is easy:

.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/4.diff
   :language: diff

The other variables we've added describes a *runtime
dependency*. Without that, the utilities would build just fine, but if
some image recipe then included the ``trig`` package, nothing has
informed OE-lite that it must also include ``libm.so`` in the
resulting image. So the binaries would be present but unrunnable. (Of
course, in a realistic full BSP, *some* recipe is bound to ensure that
libm gets included, but that's not necessarily the case for other
libraries, so it's better to always explicitly describe the exact
dependencies.)

Since our utilities end up in the package by the same name as the
recipe, we tell OE-lite that anything that run-time depends on the
``trig`` *package* should also pull in libm.

See the section `dependencies` for details on the various types of
dependencies and the variables describing them, and why the runtime
dependency was spelled ``RDEPENDS_${PN}`` rather than just
``RDEPENDS``

While we can now succesfully build the trig utilities, the recipe is
not quite complete. Looking at the directory ``${WORKDIR}/packages``,
we see that all the packages are empty apart from some auto-generated
metadata. The problem is that we haven't described how to install the
utilities. Most »real« recipes get built using a Makefile (which may
be generated by autotools or whatnot), in which case there is usually
also an ``install`` target, and if we had inherited the ``make``
class, OE-lite would by default simply do ``make install``. We,
however, have to describe the install step manually, just as we
defined the do_compile function. So here goes


.. literalinclude:: examples/trig/5.diff
   :language: diff

If we then run ``oe bake trig -y`` and look at the directory ``${D}``
(aka ``${WORKDIR}/install``), we see that the three utilities are
there. Moreover, the do_install task by default strips debug symbols
and puts them in the ``.debug`` subdirectory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tree -a -F tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/install/
   tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/install/
   └── usr/
       └── bin/
           ├── cos*
           ├── .debug/
           │   ├── cos*
           │   ├── sin*
           │   └── tan*
           ├── sin*
           └── tan*

   3 directories, 6 files

The next task is do_split, which takes the contents of the ``${D}``
directory and distributes the files in subdirectories of
``${WORKDIR}/packages`` according to the ``FILES_*`` variables. These
have reasonable default values, so we get this structure:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tree -a -F tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/packages/
   tmp/work/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-0.1/packages/
   ├── trig/
   │   └── usr/
   │       └── bin/
   │           ├── cos*
   │           ├── sin*
   │           └── tan*
   ├── trig-dbg/
   │   └── usr/
   │       └── bin/
   │           └── .debug/
   │               ├── cos*
   │               ├── sin*
   │               └── tan*
   ├── trig-dev/
   ├── trig-doc/
   └── trig-locale/

   10 directories, 6 files

This allows one to RDEPEND on ``trig``, but if one also wants the
debug symbols, one should also add a run-time dependency on
``trig-dbg``. The final task is do_package, which adds an OE-lite
directory containing a little metadata (using the LICENSE and
DESCRIPTION variables), and then creates a tarball which is placed in
a subdirectory of ``tmp/packages``:


.. code-block:: console

   $ ls -F tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig*
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig_0.1_f7b2f5ade7888f1426ecbe773d909f0f.tar
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig_0.1.tar@
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-dbg_0.1_f7b2f5ade7888f1426ecbe773d909f0f.tar
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-dbg_0.1.tar@
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-dev_0.1_f7b2f5ade7888f1426ecbe773d909f0f.tar
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-dev_0.1.tar@
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-doc_0.1_f7b2f5ade7888f1426ecbe773d909f0f.tar
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-doc_0.1.tar@
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-locale_0.1_f7b2f5ade7888f1426ecbe773d909f0f.tar
   tmp/packages/machine/arm-926ejs-linux-gnueabi/trig-locale_0.1.tar@

The long hex string is the metadata hash of the do_package task.

By now, we have a working recipe, and we can include the utilities on
our target by simply saying ::

  RDEPENDS += "trig"

in our root filesystem recipe. However, there are some things one
might want to improve.

- In a space-constrained root filesystem, it might be nice to be able
  to depend on the utilities individually, so that one doesn't have to
  include ``tan`` if one only needs ``cos``.

- One would not normally have the complete source code in the recipe
  directory, but instead have the SRC_URI point at a git repository or
  tar-ball containing it.

Instead of showing how to achieve this, we'll turn our attention to an
example from »real life«.

Dissection of an existing recipe
